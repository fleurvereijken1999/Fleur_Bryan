# 1D-CNN classification model

Our model is a classification model for GO-term prediction based on protein sequences


## Motivation
A deep-learning course project of Wageningen University and Research aiming to overcome the challenges of extracting functional information from large-scale omics data by designing a learning model.

## Credits
Bryan van Nimwegen and Fleur Vereijken designed the model and wrote the report.
